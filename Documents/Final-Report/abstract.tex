In this project, I implement three parametrization algorithms: Euclidean orbifold Tutte embedding \cite{Aigerman:2015:OTE:2816795.2818099}, hyperbolic orbifold Tutte embedding\cite{Aigerman:2016:HOT:2980179.2982412}, and boundary first flattening\cite{1704.06873}. The Euclidean orbifold Tutte embedding uses orbifold structure to generalize the algorithm in \cite{Gortler:2006:DOM:1133946.1648437} to sphere-type meshes. Hyperbolic orbifold Tutte embedding generalize the Euclidean orbifold Tutte embedding in the sense of geometry. But this generalization in non-linear. Besides, the Euclidean orbifold Tutte is also claimed to be conformal, so this algorithm provide a new linear method to compute conformal maps. Boundary first flattening is another linear conformal map solver. But this algorithm is based on differential geometry.
