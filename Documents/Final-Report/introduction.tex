\section{Introduction}
Parameterization is very important to many graphics applications. In this project, I explored two kinds of parameterization algorithms. The former is what in my \textbf{proposal}. The latter is what I did extra for the \textbf{bonus points}.

The first one is orbifold Tutte embedding \cite{Aigerman:2015:OTE:2816795.2818099}\cite{Aigerman:2016:HOT:2980179.2982412} . The behaviors of orbifolds is different in different background geometry, and I explored two kinds of geometry: Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. We will see later that algorithms for these two different settings are very different. One is linear and the other is non-linear.
\cite{Aigerman:2017:SOT:3072959.3073615} is about spherical orbfolds. But in the level of implementation, there is no difference with hyperbolic orbifolds, except the distance function and isometries.

The second one is boundary first flattening \cite{1704.06873}. This algorithm is in the mindset of differential geometry and conformal geometry. And this algorithm is linear. 

This report is organized as follows: First I talk about the tools I used to implement my project. Then I separate the rest of report into two parts to introduce two kinds of algorithm separately.
