\section{Theoretical Backgroud}
\subsection{Euclidean Orbifold Tutte Embedding}
The first part of my project is Euclidean orbifold Tutte embedding\cite{Aigerman:2015:OTE:2816795.2818099}. This algorithm is a generalization of so-called Tutte graph embedding based on the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{tutte-theorem}
Let $G = \left<V , E , F \right>$ be a 3-connected planar graph with boundary vertices $B \subset V$ defining a unique unbounded exterior face $f_e$ . Suppose $\partial f_e$ is embedded in the plane as a (not necessarily strictly) convex planar polygon, and each interior vertex is positioned in the plane as a strictly convex combination of its neighbors, then the straight-line drawing of $G$ with these vertex positions is an embedding. In addition, this embedding has strictly convex interior faces.
\end{theorem}
The embedding problem is the following full-rank linear system:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{v_j \in \mathit{N}(v_i)} w_{ij}x_j &= x_i, i = 1, ..., |V - B|\\
\sum_{v_j \in \mathit{N}(v_i)} w_{ij}y_j &= y_i, i = 1, ..., |V - B|\\
x_i &= b_i^x, i = |V-B| + 1, ... , |V|\\
y_i &= b_i^y, i = |V-B| + 1, ... , |V|
\end{split}
\label{eq:tutte}
\end{equation}
where $\sum_{j}w_{ij} = 1, \forall v_i$, and $w > 0$.
The result is guaranteed to be injective.

But this algorithm cannot be generalized onto topological sphere directly.
They \cite{Aigerman:2015:OTE:2816795.2818099} use a geometric structure called orbifold, making this method computable on sphere.

An orbifold can be treated as a tiled plane. The tile transformation is isometries. In this paper Euclidean orbifolds are used. We cut the mesh into disk to get a maximal submesh. The maximal submesh can be mapped to a tile of Euclidean plane. So besides Eq.\ref{eq:tutte}, we should make the embedding satisfy the following two conditions:

1. The embedding can tail the whole plane seamlessly.

2. The image of every vertex satisfy weighted convex combination on tiled plane.

For example, in Fig.\ref{fig:tile}, not only interior but also boundary vertices of the maximal submesh satisfy convex combination condition on the tiled plane.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/euc_orbifold}
\caption{Tiled plane.}
\label{fig:tile}
\end{figure}

The system needs to be solved is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)}w_{ij}(z_j - z_i) &= 0, &v_i \in \bar{V}-\bar{B}\\
\sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)}w_{ij}(z_j - z_i) + \sum_{v_j\in N(v_{i'})} w_{i'j}R_{i'i}(z_j - z_i')&= 0, &v_i \in \bar{B} - \bar{C}\\
z_i &= z_i^0 , &v_i \in \bar{C}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Here we cut the $M$ into a submesh $\bar{M}$, which is a disk. $\bar{C}$ is the cones of the orbifold. $\bar{B}$ is
the boundary of the submesh. And $R_{i'i}$ is the rotation part of the isometry from $i'$ to $i$.

Note that we have only four Euclidean sphere-type orbifold, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:four-kinds}. And one intresting property is that the map is actually confomal map.

\subsection{Hyperbolic Orbifold Tutte Embedding}
The second part of my projects is hyperbolic orbifold Tutte embedding \cite{Aigerman:2016:HOT:2980179.2982412}. 
Hyperbolic orbifold Tutte embedding  is the generalization of Euclidean orbifold Tutte embedding. We treat a hyperbolic orbifold as a tiled Poincare disk by a basic tile. But hyperbolic isometries are non linear. Besides we use a non linear generalization of Tutte embedding:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\min_{\Phi}\ \ \   E(\Phi) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{(i,j)\in E} w_{ij} d(z_i, z_j)^2 \\
s.t \ \ \   &z_i = z_i^0, \ \ \ \ v_i \in B
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $d$ is the distance function in corresponding geometry. This system is equivalent to Eq.\ref{eq:tutte} in Euclidean geometry.

We use this generalization to get hyperbolic orbifolds:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\min_{\Phi} E(\Phi),&\\
s.t \ \ \ &z_i = m_{i'i}(z_{i'}), &v_i \in \bar{B} - \bar{C}\\
 &z_i = z_i^0, &v_i \in \bar{C}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here $d$ is hyperbolic distance function and $m_{i'i}$ is hyperbolic isometry from $i'$ to $i$.

The distance has explicit expression whose first order derivative is easily computed. So we can use first-order optimization algorithm to optimaize this problem.

A result from paper is showned in Fig.\ref{fig:hyper-orbifold}
